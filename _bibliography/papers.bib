  title={Unveiling potential threats: backdoor attacks in single-cell pretrained models},
  author={Shengquan Chen ,Sicheng Feng et al.},
  abstract={Single-cell pretrained models, despite their superior performance, face significant yet often overlooked threats from backdoor attacks. Here we propose a straightforward backdoor strategy to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of these models, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy. We also suggest five potential defense strategies to mitigate these threats. Our findings underscore the imperative for the biomedical community to adopt robust defense mechanisms to safeguard research integrity and reliability.},
